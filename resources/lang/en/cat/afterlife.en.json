        "dark_forest_default_0": "Power and authority, confidence and excitement - it had called to m_c, pulled {PRONOUN/m_c/object} like magnets in {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} blood. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} soon walked the Dark Forest, raising {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} voice to call to others in turn.",

        "dark_forest_default_6": "The stories told, the legacy made, the legend they left behind - all of that mattered to m_c far more than the Dark Forest that greeted {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} spirit at death.",
        "dark_forest_default_7": "The earthly loam of the forest floor filled m_c's nose upon waking. Even before opening {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} eyes, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} knew where {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} affinity had led {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} soul.",

        "dark_forest_rejected_0": "m_c was not worth investing in. The Dark Forest turned away from {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} spirit, leaving the weakling to be scavenged by StarClan.",
        "dark_forest_rejected_1": "Power and authority, confidence and excitement - none of that came to mind when presented with m_c. Better for the stars to take the leftovers that the forest does not value.",
        "dark_forest_rejected_2": "m_c's spirit slipped from the grasping claws of the Dark Forest, rising to StarClan.",
        "dark_forest_rejected_3": "There was nothing in the Dark Forest that could tempt m_c, and {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} became a star instead.",

        "dark_forest_rejected_6": "Not all see the value in the strength of the deep woods. It is difficult to say - did m_c escape to StarClan, or did the forest let {PRONOUN/m_c/object} go?",
        "dark_forest_rejected_7": "If the denizens of the Dark Forest catch m_c, they will kill {PRONOUN/m_c/object}. But first, they have to catch {PRONOUN/m_c/object} - and m_c has already escaped to the stars.",

        "dark_forest_contentious_0": "The forest's souls whispered with uncertainty, like wind brushing gently through branches. But m_c was welcomed into the deep woods nonetheless.",
        "dark_forest_contentious_1": "m_c's spirit twanged, a note out of tune with the whole. Yet in such a silent world as is held in the deep worlds, there is room for such spirits.",
        "dark_forest_contentious_2": "Though there was the quiver of uncertainty in their soul, exposed and easy to see, m_c still coveted what the forest offered, and stepped into its depths.",
        "dark_forest_contentious_3": "There was something in m_c worth the trouble {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} spirit was sure to bring with {PRONOUN/m_c/object}. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/were/was} welcomed into the Dark Forest.",
        "dark_forest_contentious_4": "The Dark Forest called to m_c. Not overwhelmingly, not drowning out all others - but it called nonetheless, and m_c's spirit answered.",
        "dark_forest_contentious_5": "The path to the Dark Forest was imprinted with the pawprints of m_c's good intentions.",

        "dark_forest_kit_0": "m_c followed the well-worn paths into the darkened woods around {PRONOUN/m_c/object} without question.",
        "dark_forest_kit_1": "m_c reached a shadowed hollow, still and quiet. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} hadn't seen any cat, and didn't know how {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} got so far from camp.",
        "dark_forest_kit_2": "The wind rustled through the trees, shadowed tangled on the ground, and m_c stepped into an afterlife peaceful, still, and quiet.",
        "dark_forest_kit_3": "The new world was damp and dark, but not unwelcoming to m_c.",
        "dark_forest_kit_4": "m_c wandered the Dark Forest, a little confused, but mostly curious."
